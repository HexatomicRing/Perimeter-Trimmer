# Perimeter Trimmer

## Automatically build beacons

Place a beacon and right click with a valid block(iron bloc, etc.) in your hand. Then the mod will automatically build the rest part of the beacon with this kind of block in your inventory.

You need to reserve enough space for a larger beacon.

## Trim your perimeter

After right-clicked a bedrock with nothing in your hand then right-click twice in one second to enter this mode. This mod will help you to automatically break bedrocks, fill fluids and mine stones.

Please assert that you have pistons, redstone torches and slime blocks in your hot bar(NOT JUST IN YOUR INVENTORY!!!), and have the effect of haste II.

The bedrock at y=0 will not be broken, and you cannot use this function at y>64. Any block with blocks above will not be broken in order to protect the border of the perimeter.

Right click any block, you will start to break any block that you can break instantly around you.

Right click again to exit this mode.
